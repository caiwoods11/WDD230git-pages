                A visual hierarchy causes users' eyes to follow a predictable reading path, 
                which leads users to the web page's functionality. Studies that track eye 
                movement have shown there is a pattern to the movement across a screen. 
                Placement, typography, whitespace, size, color, alignment, texture, and 
                layout style of the webpage affect where a user's eyes are drawn. 
                The visual hierarchy of a web page gives users visual cues to view the 
                page as the creator would have the users focus on what's most important 
                first.

                White space encourages balance and creates a more focused environment 
                for the user because of the effect white space has on the design, legibility, 
                and readability of content. It enhances the user experience by creating breaks 
                and spaces to improve readability, such as spacing between words or paragraphs. 
                Using too little whitespace can seriously affect legibility and usability. 
                Conversely, using too much white space can send the wrong message about your 
                brand due to an unclear design vision.

                Fitts's Law is a function that helps creators design better buttons, 
                forms, lists, and other interactive elements. The formula uses the size 
                and distance of targets to determine how long it takes a user to capture 
                a mark on a GUI. The goal is to make interactions easy and intuitive. 
                For example, buttons that submit the information entered into a form 
                should be close to the information entered. Likewise, basic buttons and 
                controls have better recognition are more prominent in size. Ultimately, 
                large objects with short search times can lower the interaction cost.
